// The ANAN-G2 receive DSP stage: turns raw DDC0 IQ blocks (from
// P2Client::ddc0IqReady) into demodulated audio (WdspChannel), a panadapter
// spectrum (AnanPanAnalyzer, WDSP's display analyzer), and an uncalibrated
// raw signal-peak reading kept
// below the seam until a measured dBFS-to-dBm calibration exists. The eventual
// AnanBackend owns one and runs it on the backend's I/O thread. Mirrors
// Hl2RxDsp's shape closely -- same WdspChannel, same "owns a DSP chain"
// branch of the seam already proven there -- but scoped to exactly what
// aetherd ANAN P2 Phase 1b needs (see 02-working-plan.md Step 2): no noise
// blanker, no manual notch filters. Both are real HL2 features and neither
// is speculative to add later; they are simply not part of this phase's
// one-DDC, RX-only scope, matching Hl2RxDsp's OWN history -- its notch/NB
// machinery arrived in later commits, not its first one.
//
// *** READ HERMES.md §16 ("Receive handedness and tuning — the two-error
// trap") BEFORE TOUCHING processIqBlock(). *** It documents the most
// expensive bug in this project's history: Hl2RxDsp handed the demodulator
// and the spectrum the WRONG IQ handedness for a full bring-up cycle. This
// class's conjugate split mirrors Hl2RxDsp's STRUCTURE (proven: WDSP's own
// passband-sign convention transfers unchanged) -- and, as of 2026-08-21,
// its polarity is CONFIRMED for Protocol 2 too, not just assumed: both
// halves of the "two-source bar" HERMES §16 sets are in. `radiocert rx`
// (2026-08-19, real WWV carrier) showed the textbook USB/DIGU-recover,
// LSB/DIGL-don't signature. Then, independently, an RSP1B running SDR++ --
// sharing zero code with this backend -- reproduced the exact same
// USB-hears/LSB-doesn't pattern at the same dial/offset geometry, and
// visually confirmed the panadapter draws the carrier on the correct side
// of the dial. See processIqBlock()'s handedness comment for the mechanism
// this confirms. Since the move to WDSP's analyzer the spectrum's mirror is
// done INSIDE the analyzer (Spectrum0() swaps I and Q), so both paths are fed
// the raw wire and nothing in this class conjugates; the handedness test pins
// that a wire-convention tone above centre still lands above centre.
