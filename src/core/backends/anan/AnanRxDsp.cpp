    //      passband bounds. A property of THIS CODEBASE's WdspChannel
    //      configuration, which Protocol 2 reuses unchanged. Known with full
    //      confidence since before this backend existed.
    //   2. "The HPSDR wire is the conjugate of the analytic convention" --
    //      originally measured against Protocol 1 / the HL2 only, and only a
    //      plausible starting point for Protocol 2's different wire encoding
    //      (typed packets vs C0 register banks). Now independently confirmed
    //      for THIS radio too: `radiocert rx` (2026-08-19, real WWV carrier)
    //      showed the textbook USB/DIGU-recover, LSB/DIGL-don't signature,
    //      and an RSP1B running SDR++ -- sharing zero code with this
    //      backend -- reproduced the identical pattern at the same dial/
    //      offset geometry and confirmed the panadapter draws the carrier on
    //      the correct side. That is the "two-source bar" HERMES §16 sets
    //      before a polarity claim can be trusted; both are in.
    //
    // Fact 1 alone already implies the demodulator and the spectrum must get
    // OPPOSITE handling from each other. Which one gets the mirror and which
    // gets the raw wire is fact 2's contribution -- demodulator raw, spectrum
    // mirrored, same structure Hl2RxDsp settled on, now confirmed correct
    // here too, not just structurally borrowed (HERMES.md §16.6 rule 2 --
    // mirror exactly once, at one place).
    //
    // That one place is now INSIDE WDSP's analyzer: Spectrum0() reads each
    // sample's Q as I and I as Q, and swapping the two mirrors the spectrum
    // exactly as a conjugate does. So this function hands BOTH paths the raw
    // wire and conjugates nothing; adding a conjugate here as well would
    // mirror twice and put every signal on the wrong side of the dial.
    // anan_rxdsp_handedness_test pins a wire-convention tone above centre
    // landing above centre through this whole path.
